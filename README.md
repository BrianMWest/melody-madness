# Melody Madness

![Game screenshot](img/screenshot.png)

I made this game during the COVID-19 social distancing and shelter-in-place
rules for the St. Luke's Community Orchestra to maintain a sense of community
and togetherness.
The game is a musical composition challenge in which the participants fight to
write a melody one note at a time.
The current note is controlled by typing "up" and "down" commands in a
designated Slack channel the players have access to (determined with environment
variables).
At the end, the notes are played back so everyone can hear the monstrosity they
have created.

This project also serves as an example for a WIP game engine I have been writing
that uses a combination of Rust and Ruby to create simple 2D games.
